# SSLCerts
An SSL certificate is a digital document that verifies a website's identity and enables secure, encrypted connections between the website and a user's web browser. This encryption ensures that any data transmitted between the browser and the server remains private and secure. Essentially, SSL certificates are like ID cards for websites, proving they are who they say they are and that they can be trusted to handle secure transactions.
